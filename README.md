# HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Prediction

This repository was developed by **I Made Akira Ivandio Agusta (15406525),** Coventry University.

This study explores **Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) with Bayesian Optimisation** to enhance HIV-1 protease cleavage prediction. The experiments include cross-validation and rigorous cross-dataset evaluation across four HIV-protease datasets: **746, 1625, Schilling, and Impens.** The datasets were collected from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/330/hiv+1+protease+cleavage) and stored in the **dataset** directory.

Referring to the **HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Prediction** notebook results, this study concludes that the optimal model is **GPC with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.**
